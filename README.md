# KetPath
This repository provides the code for the KetPath (Ketamine Pathway Knowledge Graph), a biomedical pathway knowledge graph designed for exploring the pathways of the antidepressant Ketamine, and Ketamine's effects on brain mneurotransmitters and gut microbiota. This project is done by [IBIVU](http://www.ibi.vu.nl/) and [L&R](https://lr.cs.vu.nl/) group, Verije Universteit Amsterdam. Please refer to our paper "A biomedical literature derived ketamine pathway knowledge graph" for more detail which published on xxx.

# SPARQL
We provide four SPARQL query cases with the code and their results. Users can perform their own queries by changing parameters in templates that we designed.

# Download
The Schema Data of the KetPath, SPARQL query codes, and query results are available at [KetPath Page](https://github.com/tingcosmos/KetPath).
